Policy and procedures reflect applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, regulations, policies, standards, and guidance. Security program policies and procedures at the organization level may make the need for system-specific policies and procedures unnecessary. The policy can be included as part of the general information security policy for organizations or, conversely, can be represented by multiple policies reflecting the complex nature of certain organizations. The procedures can be established for the security program in general and for information systems, if needed.

Privacy requirements commonly use the terms “adequate security” and “confidentiality” when referring to access controls and other security safeguards for PII. Applied together, these terms signify the need to make risk-based decisions based on the magnitude of harm (to both organizations and individuals) when determining applicable restrictions for PII. For this overlay, refer to the definitions of “adequate security” in OMB Circular A-130, Appendix III, and “confidentiality” in NIST SP 800-37, Rev. 1, Appendix B. These definitions are consistent with Committee for National Security Systems Instruction (CNSSI) No. 4009.\r\n\r\n',' PM-9, AR-4, AR-7'),(2,'AC-02','Access Control','Account Management ','P1','High; Moderate; Low','The organization: a.

Some of the account management requirements listed can be implemented by organizational information systems. The identification of authorized users of the information system and the specification of access privileges reflects the requirements in other security controls in the security plan. Users requiring administrative privileges on information system accounts receive additional scrutiny by appropriate organizational personnel (e.g., system owner, mission/business owner, or CISO) responsible for approving such accounts and privileged access. Organizations may choose to define access privileges or other attributes by account, by type of account, or a combination of both. Other attributes required for authorizing access include, for example, restrictions on time-of-day, day-of-week, and point-of-origin. In defining other account attributes, organizations consider system-related requirements (e.g., scheduled maintenance, system upgrades) and mission/business requirements, (e.g., time zone differences, customer requirements, remote access to support travel requirements). Failure to consider these factors could affect information system availability. Temporary and emergency accounts are accounts intended for short-term use. Organizations establish temporary accounts as a part of normal account activation procedures when there is a need for short-term accounts without the demand for immediacy in account activation. Organizations establish emergency accounts in response to crisis situations and with the need for rapid account activation. Therefore, emergency account activation may bypass normal account authorization processes. Emergency and temporary accounts are not to be confused with infrequently used accounts (e.g., local logon accounts used for special tasks defined by organizations or when network resources are unavailable). Such accounts remain available and are not subject to automatic disabling or removal dates. Conditions for disabling or deactivating accounts include, for example: (i) when shared/group, emergency, or temporary accounts are no longer required; or (ii) when individuals are transferred or terminated. Some types of information system accounts may require specialized training. Contact your CRA or the CCIC for the list of compliant formats.

Additional security safeguards may be needed to ensure that such information is adequately protected once it is passed beyond the established information system boundaries. Examples of information leaving the system boundary include transmitting information to an external information system or printing the information on one of its printers. In cases where the information system is unable to determine the adequacy of the protections provided by entities outside its boundary, as a mitigating control, organizations determine procedurally whether the external information systems are providing adequate security. The means used to determine the adequacy of the security provided by external information systems include, for example, conducting inspections or periodic testing, establishing agreements between the organization and its counterpart organizations, or some other process. The means used by external entities to protect the information received need not be the same as those used by the organization, but the means employed are sufficient to provide consistent adjudication of the security policy to protect the information. This control enhancement requires information systems to employ technical or procedural means to validate the information prior to releasing it to external systems. For example, if the information system passes information to another system controlled by another organization, technical means are employed to validate that the security attributes associated with the exported information are appropriate for the receiving system. Alternatively, if the information system passes information to a printer in organization-controlled space, procedural means can be employed to ensure that only appropriately authorized individuals gain access to the printer. This control enhancement is most applicable when there is some policy mandate (e.g., law, Executive Order, directive, or regulation) that establishes policy regarding access to the information, and that policy applies beyond the realm of an information system or organization.\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nPII released outside a system boundary may be at increased risk for unauthorized access and use (i.e., a breach).

Flow control restrictions include, for example, keeping export-controlled information from being transmitted in the clear to the Internet, blocking outside traffic that claims to be from within the organization, restricting web requests to the Internet that are not from the internal web proxy server, and limiting information transfers between organizations based on data structures and content. Transferring information between information systems representing different security domains with different security policies introduces risk that such transfers violate one or more domain security policies. In such situations, information owners/stewards provide guidance at designated policy enforcement points between interconnected systems. Organizations consider mandating specific architectural solutions when required to enforce specific security policies. Enforcement includes, for example: (i) prohibiting information transfers between interconnected systems (i.e., allowing access only); (ii) employing hardware mechanisms to enforce one-way information flows; and (iii) implementing trustworthy regarding mechanisms to reassign security attributes and security labels.Organizations commonly employ information flow control policies and enforcement mechanisms to control the flow of information between designated sources and destinations (e.g., networks, individuals, and devices) within information systems and between interconnected systems. Flow control is based on the characteristics of the information and/or the information path. Enforcement occurs, for example, in boundary protection devices (e.g., gateways, routers, guards, encrypted tunnels, firewalls) that employ rule sets or establish configuration settings that restrict information system services, provide a packet-filtering capability based on header information, or message-filtering capability based on message content (e.g., implementing key word searches or using document characteristics). Organizations also consider the trustworthiness of filtering/inspection mechanisms (i.e., hardware, firmware, and software components) that are critical to information flow enforcement. NIST SP 800-53 control enhancements 3 through 22 primarily address cross-domain solution needs which focus on more advanced filtering techniques, in-depth analysis, and stronger flow enforcement mechanisms implemented in cross-domain products, for example, high-assurance guards.

Security policy filters for data content can check for specific words (e.g., dirty/clean word filters), enumerated values or data value ranges, and hidden content. Structured data permits the interpretation of data content by applications. Unstructured data typically refers to digital information without a data structure or with a data structure that does not facilitate the development of rule sets to address the sensitivity of the information conveyed by the data or the associated flow enforcement decisions. Unstructured data consists of: (i) bitmap objects that are inherently non-language-based (i.e., image, video, or audio files); and (ii) textual objects that are based on written or printed languages (e.g., commercial off-the-shelf word processing documents, spreadsheets, or emails).

Organizations also apply least privilege to the development, implementation, and operation of organizational information systems.The concept of least privilege aligns with the notion of only allowing access to sensitive information when an individual has a need-to-know in performance of their job duties.\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nThe concept of least privilege aligns with the notion of only allowing access to PII when an individual has a need-to-know in performance of their job duties.The organization enforces the most restrictive set of rights/privileges or access needed by users (or processes acting on behalf of users) for the performance of specified tasks —increasing the level of restriction as PII confidentiality impact level rises.

Passive entities, also known as objects, are typically associated with data structures such as records, buffers, tables, files, inter-process pipes, and communications ports. Security attributes, a form of metadata, are abstractions representing the basic properties or characteristics of active and passive entities with respect to safeguarding information.

The content or assigned values of security attributes can directly affect the ability of individuals to access organizational information.Organizations can define the types of attributes needed for selected information systems to support missions/business functions. There is potentially a wide range of values that can be assigned to any given security attribute. Release markings could include, for example, US only, NATO, or NOFORN (not releasable to foreign nationals). By specifying permitted attribute ranges and values, organizations can ensure that the security attribute values are meaningful and relevant.

Mobile devices are typically associated with a single individual and the device is usually near the individual; however, the degree of proximity can vary depending upon on the form factor and size of the device. The processing, storage, and transmission capability of the mobile device may be comparable to or merely a subset of desktop systems, depending upon the nature and intended purpose of the device. Due to the large variety of mobile devices with different technical characteristics and capabilities, organizational restrictions may vary for the different classes/types of such devices. Usage restrictions and specific implementation guidance for mobile devices include, for example, configuration management, device identification and authentication, implementation of mandatory protective software (e.g., malicious code detection, firewall), scanning devices for malicious code, updating virus protection software, scanning for critical software updates and patches, conducting primary operating system (and possibly other resident software) integrity checks, and disabling unnecessary hardware (e.g., wireless, infrared).

These situations occur when, for example, there are pre-existing sharing/trust agreements (either implicit or explicit) established between federal agencies or organizations subordinate to those agencies, or when such trust agreements are specified by applicable laws, Executive Orders, directives, or policies. Authorized individuals include, for example, organizational personnel, contractors, or other individuals with authorized access to organizational information systems and over which organizations have the authority to impose rules of behavior regarding system access. Restrictions that organizations impose on authorized individuals need not be uniform, as those restrictions may vary depending upon the trust relationships between organizations.

Organizations identify audit events as those events which are significant and relevant to the security of information systems and the environments in which those systems operate to meet specific and ongoing audit needs. Audit events can include, for example, password changes, failed logons, or failed accesses related to information systems, administrative privilege usage, PIV credential usage, or third-party credential usage. In determining the set of auditable events, organizations consider the auditing appropriate for each of the security controls to be implemented. To balance auditing requirements with other information system needs, this control also requires identifying that subset of auditable events that are audited at a given point in time. For example, organizations may determine that information systems must have the capability to log every file access both successful and unsuccessful, but not activate that capability except for specific circumstances due to the potential burden on system performance. Auditing requirements, including the need for auditable events, may be referenced in other security controls and control enhancements. Organizations also include auditable events that are required by applicable federal laws, Executive Orders, directives, policies, regulations, and standards. Audit records can be generated at various levels of abstraction, including at the packet level as information traverses the network. Selecting the appropriate level of abstraction is a critical aspect of an audit capability and can facilitate the identification of root causes to problems. Organizations consider in the definition of auditable events, the auditing necessary to cover related events such as the steps in distributed, transaction-based processes (e.g., processes that are distributed across multiple organizations) and actions that occur in service-oriented architectures.The Federal Rules of Evidence can be found at this website: http://www.uscourts.gov/file/rules-evidence  \r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nThis control identifies privacy-relevant security auditable events using a risk-based approach.

Initial authenticator content is the actual content (e.g., the initial password) as opposed to requirements about authenticator content (e.g., minimum password length). In many cases, developers ship information system components with factory default authentication credentials to allow for initial installation and configuration. Default authentication credentials are often well-known, easily discoverable, and present a significant security risk. The requirement to protect individual authenticators may be implemented via control PL-4 or PS-6 for authenticators in the possession of individuals and by controls AC-3, AC-6, and SC-28 for authenticators stored within organizational information systems (e.g., passwords stored in hashed or encrypted formats, files containing encrypted or hashed passwords accessible with administrator privileges). Information systems support individual authenticator management by organization-defined settings and restrictions for various authenticator characteristics including, for example, minimum password length, password composition, validation time window for time synchronous one-time tokens, and number of allowed rejections during the verification stage of biometric authentication. Specific actions that can be taken to safeguard authenticators include, for example, maintaining possession of individual authenticators, not loaning or sharing individual authenticators with others, and reporting lost, stolen, or compromised authenticators immediately. Authenticator management includes issuing and revoking, when no longer needed, authenticators for temporary access such as that required for remote maintenance. Device authenticators include, for example, certificates and passwords.\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nAdequate security to ensure confidentiality for an information system containing sensitive information such as personally identifiable information (PII) is achieved through the management of the authenticators permitting access to that system.

Security plans also describe, at a high level, how the security controls and control enhancements meet those security requirements but do not provide detailed, technical descriptions of the specific design or implementation of the controls/enhancements. Security plans contain sufficient information (including the specification of parameter values for assignment and selection statements either explicitly or by reference) to enable a design and implementation that is unambiguously compliant with the intent of the plans and subsequent determinations of risk to organizational operations and assets, individuals, other organizations, and the Nation if the plan is implemented as intended. Organizations can also apply tailoring guidance to the security control baselines in NIST 800-53 Appendix D and Committee on National Security Systems (CNSS) Instruction 1253 to develop overlays for community-wide use or to address specialized requirements, technologies, or missions/environments of operation (e.g., DoD-tactical, Federal Public Key Infrastructure, or Federal Identity, Credential, and Access Management, space operations). NIST 800-53 Appendix I provides guidance on developing overlays.Security plans need not be single documents; the plans can be a collection of various documents, including documents that already exist. Effective security plans make extensive use of references to policies, procedures, and additional documents (e.g., design and implementation specifications) where more detailed information can be obtained. This reduces the documentation requirements associated with security programs and maintains security-related information in other established management/operational areas related to enterprise architecture, system development life cycle, systems engineering, and acquisition. For example, security plans do not contain detailed contingency plan or incident response plan information but instead provide explicitly or by reference sufficient information to define what needs to be accomplished by those plans.All COSA information systems and major applications are covered by a security plan, which is compliant with current COSA procedures.\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nThe SSP is necessary for the information system to be authorized.

The information security architecture at the individual information system level is consistent with and complements the more global, organization-wide information security architecture described in PM-7 that is integral to and developed as part of the enterprise architecture. The information security architecture includes an architectural description, the placement/allocation of security functionality (including security controls), security-related information for external interfaces, information being exchanged across the interfaces, and the protection mechanisms associated with each interface. In addition, the security architecture can include other important security-related information, for example, user roles and access privileges assigned to each role, unique security requirements, the types of information processed, stored, and transmitted by the information system, restoration priorities of information and information system services, and any other specific protection needs.In today’s modern architecture, it is becoming less common for organizations to control all information resources. There are going to be key dependencies on external information services and service providers (to include CSPs). Describing such dependencies in the information security architecture is important to developing a comprehensive mission/business protection strategy. Establishing, developing, documenting, and maintaining under configuration control, a baseline configuration for organizational information systems is critical to implementing and maintaining an effective information security architecture. The development of the information security architecture is coordinated with the Senior Agency Official for Privacy (SAOP)/Chief Privacy Officer (CPO) to ensure that security controls needed to support privacy requirements are identified and effectively implemented. PL-8 is primarily directed at organizations (i.e., internally focused) to help ensure that organizations develop an information security architecture for the information system, and that the security architecture is integrated with or tightly coupled to the enterprise architecture through the organization-wide information security architecture. In contrast, SA-17 is primarily directed at external information technology product/system developers and integrators (although SA-17 could be used internally within organizations for in-house system development).

Organizations determine the required vulnerability scanning for all information system components, ensuring that potential sources of vulnerabilities such as networked printers, scanners, and copiers are not overlooked. Vulnerability analyses for custom software applications may require additional approaches such as static analysis, dynamic analysis, binary analysis, or a hybrid of the three approaches. Organizations can employ these analysis approaches in a variety of tools (e.g., web-based application scanners, static analysis tools, binary analyzers) and in source code reviews. Vulnerability scanning includes, for example: (i) scanning for patch levels; (ii) scanning for functions, ports, protocols, and services that should not be accessible to users or devices; and (iii) scanning for improperly configured or incorrectly operating information flow control mechanisms.

Accountability begins with the appointment of a SOP with the authority, mission, resources, and responsibility to develop and implement a multifaceted privacy program. The SOP, in consultation with legal counsel, information security officials, and others as appropriate: (i) ensures the development, implementation, and enforcement of privacy policies and procedures; (ii) defines roles and responsibilities for protecting PII; (iii) determines the level of information sensitivity with regard to PII holdings; (iv) identifies the laws, regulations, and internal policies that apply to the PII; (v) monitors privacy best practices; and (vi) monitors/audits compliance with identified privacy controls.To further accountability, the SOP develops privacy plans to document the privacy requirements of organizations and the privacy and security controls in place or planned for meeting those requirements. The plan serves as evidence of organizational privacy operations and supports resource requests by the SOP.

Privacy Impact Assessments (PIAs) are structured reviews (qualitative and quantitative) of both the risk and effect of how information is handled and maintained as well as the potential impacts or harms to individuals and organizations for loss of control or mishandling of the PII. The term “PIA” may refer to the process of conducting such an assessment, or the document produced as a result of that assessment. A PIA-like process benefits an organization and the individuals whose PII is in the information system by enabling the organization to identify, evaluate, and manage the privacy risks for the PII in that system.Organizational privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycles of all mission/business processes that collect, use, maintain, share, or dispose of PII. The tools and processes for managing risk are specific to organizational missions and resources. Such tools include, but are not limited to, conducting PIAs. OMB Memorandum 03-22 provides guidance to organizations for implementing the privacy provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002, including guidance on the timing for developing PIAs for information systems and electronic collections of information. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to extend the PIA requirement to other activities involving PII or otherwise impacting privacy (e.g., programs, projects, or regulations). PIAs are conducted to identify privacy risks and identify methods to mitigate those risks. PIAs are also conducted to ensure that programs or information systems comply with legal, regulatory, and policy requirements. PIAs also serve as notice to the public of privacy practices. PIAs are performed before developing or procuring information systems, or initiating programs or projects, that collect, use, maintain, or share PII and are updated when changes create new privacy risks.Information system privacy risk management processes operate across the life cycle of an information system collecting, using, maintaining, and/or disseminating PII. Such privacy risk management processes include, but are not limited to, design requirements, privacy threshold analysis, privacy impact assessments (PIA), and implementation of secure disposition. While Section 208 of the E-Government Act does not require — or prohibit — a PIA for a national security system (NSS), as defined at 40 U.S.C. §11103 (see Section 202(i) of the E-Government Act), an organization may benefit from conducting a PIA or similar privacy risk evaluation on NSS as part of their internal risk management process to ensure privacy risks are identified, evaluated, and managed in information systems containing PII.

Implementation of this control enables organizations to automate application of privacy controls. One simple example, which many organizations have already implemented, is TR-1, “Privacy Notice.” This concept is one part of the most commonly recognized approaches to “building privacy in,” which is sometimes also known as “Privacy by Design.” Privacy by Design is an internationally accepted privacy best practice endorsed by the Federal Trade Commission in their March 2012 Final Report, “Protecting Consumer Privacy in an Era of Rapid Change: Recommendations for Businesses and Policymakers,” and embodies the same principles of the Privacy Act and Section 208 of the E-Government Act requiring privacy protections and safeguards before establishing or operating a system that may contain PII. Privacy by Design calls for considering privacy risks in the design and management of information systems. In addition to building in security and privacy controls discussed throughout the COSA, this control considers additional privacy-specific system characteristics and controls that must be built into the system to address privacy risks.To the extent feasible, when designing organizational information systems, organizations employ technologies and system capabilities that automate privacy controls on the collection, use, retention, and disclosure of personally identifiable information (PII). By building privacy controls into system design and development, organizations mitigate privacy risks to PII, thereby reducing the likelihood of information system breaches and other privacy-related incidents. Organizations also conduct periodic reviews of systems to determine the need for updates to maintain compliance with the Privacy Act and the organization’s privacy policy. Regardless of whether automated privacy controls are employed, organizations regularly monitor information system use and sharing of PII to ensure that the use/sharing is consistent with the authorized purposes identified in the Privacy Act and/or in the public notice of organizations, or in a manner compatible with those purposes.Additional guidance on privacy-enhanced design and development may be found in the HHS Enterprise Performance Lifecycle (EPLC). Regardless of the systems engineering lifecycle used, privacy requirements should be considered during system design and development and validated and verified along with other system requirements.

Therefore, the organization needs to take measures to reduce that risk.Organizations often use PII for testing new applications or information systems prior to deployment. Organizations also use PII for research purposes and for training. The use of PII in testing, research, and training increases risk of unauthorized disclosure or misuse of the information. If PII must be used, organizations take measures to minimize any associated risks and to authorize the use of and limit the amount of PII for these purposes. Organizations consult with the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) and legal counsel to ensure that the use of PII in testing, training, and research is compatible with the original purpose for which it was collected.When PII is of a sufficiently sensitive nature, to the greatest extent possible, PII should not be used when testing or developing an information system.\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\r\n\r\nHIPAA has specific requirements for the use of PHI in training or research.  As indicated by the HIPAA Privacy Rule’s “health care operations” definition (45 C.F.R. §164.501), covered entities may use PHI for conducting training programs in which students, trainees, or practitioners in areas of health care learn under supervision to practice or improve their skills as health care providers. Covered entities may also use PHI for conducting training of non-health care professionals, and in the course of accreditation, certification, licensing, or credentialing activities.

The first is the de-identification of information that results in that information no longer being classified as PHI.  There are only two methods for de-identification permitted by HIPAA.  For specific details on those two methods see 45 C.F.R. §164.514(a).  The second requirement is commonly referred to as the “Minimum Necessary Rule” which limits the amount of PHI used or disclosed to that which is reasonably necessary to accomplish the purpose for which the request for information is made.  See 45 §C.F.R. §164.514(d).  The third requirement allows covered entities to use or disclose a “limited data set”, which excludes certain direct identifiers.  Unlike de-identified data, a limited data set is PHI and any use or disclosure must meet specific requirements set out on the HIPAA Privacy Rule.

To obtain consent, organizations provide individuals appropriate notice of the purposes of the PII collection or technology use and a means for individuals to consent to the activity. Organizations tailor the public notice and consent mechanisms to meet operational needs. Organizations achieve awareness and consent, for example, through updated public notices.Organizations may obtain consent through opt-in, opt-out, or implied consent. Opt-in consent is the preferred method, but it is not always feasible. Opt-in requires that individuals take affirmative action to allow organizations to collect or use PII. For example, opt-in consent may require an individual to click a radio button on a website, or sign a document providing consent. In contrast, opt-out requires individuals to act to prevent the new or continued collection or use of such PII. For example, the Federal Trade Commission’s Do-Not-Call Registry allows individuals to opt-out of receiving unsolicited telemarketing calls by requesting to be added to a list. Implied consent is the least preferred method and should be used only in limited circumstances. Implied consent occurs where individuals’ behavior or failure to object indicates agreement with the collection or use of PII (e.g., by entering and remaining in a building where notice has been posted that security cameras are in use, the individual implies consent to the video recording). Depending upon the nature of the program or information system, it may be appropriate to allow individuals to limit the types of PII they provide and subsequent uses of that PII. Organizational consent mechanisms include a discussion of the consequences to individuals of failure to provide PII. Consequences can vary from organization to organization.Whenever feasible, opt-in is the preferred method to obtain consent.\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\r\n\r\nConsent is a term under HIPAA with specific meaning not equivalent to a HIPAA authorization.

The Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, requires organizations to provide mechanisms for individuals to gain access to their PII when that PII meets the definition of a “record.” Access is also an important aspect of supporting correction of PII and redress against alleged violations and misuse of their PII. In addition to access requirements under the Privacy Act of 1974, as amended, HIPAA has statutory requirements to provide access to PHI.Access affords individuals the ability to review PII about them held within organizational systems of records. Access includes timely, simplified, and inexpensive access to data. Organizational processes for allowing access to records may differ based on resources, legal requirements, or other factors. The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) working with the Privacy Act Officer is responsible for the content of Privacy Act regulations and record request processing, in consultation with legal counsel. Access to certain types of records may not be appropriate, however, and heads of agencies may promulgate rules exempting systems from the access provision of the Privacy Act. For example, individuals are not entitled to access to information compiled in reasonable anticipation of a civil action or proceeding. For other examples where agencies may promulgate rules exempting systems from the access provision, see the Privacy Act at 5 USC § 552a, subsections (j) (General Exemptions) and (k) (Specific Exemptions).Organizations must provide for public access to records, including PII not included in a Privacy Act System of Records, where required or appropriate. While the language of this control is specific to the Privacy Act’s requirements for access, FIPPs encourage organizations to use available authorities to provide access when the Privacy Act does not apply. For example, some organizations use the Freedom of Information Act as another tool to provide access to PII for an affected individual.\r\n\r\n',' AR-8, IP-3, TR-1, TR-2'),(474,'IP-03','Individual Participation and Redress','Redress ','P1','High; Moderate; Low','Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nThe organization: a.

Effective redress processes demonstrate organizational commitment to data quality especially in those business functions where inaccurate data may result in inappropriate decisions or denial of benefits and services to individuals. Organizations use discretion in determining if records are to be corrected or amended, based on the scope of redress requests, the changes sought, and the impact of the changes. Individuals may appeal an adverse decision and have incorrect, incomplete, or out-of-date information amended, where appropriate.To provide effective redress, organizations: (i) provide effective notice of the existence of a PII collection; (ii) provide plain language explanations of the processes and mechanisms for requesting access to records; (iii) establish criteria for submitting requests for correction or amendment; (iv) implement resources to analyze and adjudicate requests; (v) implement means of correcting or amending data collections; and (vi) review any decisions that may have been the result of inaccurate information.Organizational redress processes provide responses to individuals of decisions to deny requests for correction or amendment, including the reasons for those decisions, a means to record individual objections to the organizational decisions, and a means of requesting organizational reviews of the initial determinations. Where PII is corrected, or amended, organizations take steps to ensure that all authorized recipients of that PII are informed of the corrected or amended information.

The organization privacy incident and breach response capability must be able to demonstrate knowledge of the privacy incident and breach response processes and procedures and evidence showing the plan is followed routinely while responding to privacy incidents and breaches.In contrast to the Incident Response (IR) family in NIST 800-53 Appendix F, which concerns a broader range of incidents affecting information security, this control uses the term Privacy Incident to describe only those incidents that relate to personally identifiable information (PII). The organization Privacy Incident Response Plan is developed under the leadership of the Senior Official for Privacy (SOP). The plan includes: (i) The establishment of a cross-functional Privacy Incident Response Team that reviews, approves, and participates in the execution of the Privacy Incident Response Plan; (ii) A process to determine whether notice to oversight organizations or affected individuals is appropriate and to provide that notice accordingly; (iii) A privacy risk assessment process to determine the extent of harm, embarrassment, inconvenience, or unfairness to affected individuals and, where appropriate, to take steps to mitigate any such risks; (iv) Internal procedures to ensure prompt reporting by employees and contractors of any privacy incident to the SOP and other designated officials consistent with organizational incident management structures; and (v) Internal procedures for reporting noncompliance with organizational privacy policy by employees or contractors to appropriate management or oversight officials. Some organizations may be required by law or policy to provide notice to oversight organizations in the event of a breach.Organizations may also choose to integrate Privacy Incident Response Plans with Security Incident Response Plans or keep the plans separate.The Best Judgment Standard, explained in OMB M-17-12, Footnote 6, imposes a requirement for organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. The Best Judgment Standard gives organizations responsibility for their own data in two important ways. First, the organization must determine the sensitivity of its PII, based on the information and the context in which the information appears. Second, the organization must determine whether a privacy breach should be reported, based on the resultant privacy risk to the organization and to affected individuals. The Best Judgment Standard effectively imposes a requirement on organizations to develop and implement a risk-based analysis for privacy breaches to determine whether the breach needs to be reported. In the context of breach reporting, the purpose of the Best Judgment Standard is to limit reporting to those privacy breaches which meet the organization’s risk threshold. Conversely, under the Best Judgment Standard, organizations are not required to report privacy breaches that do not meet their risk threshold. The policy provides an example of implementing the Best Judgment Standard as discarding a document with the author’s name on the front and no other PII into an office trashcan, positing that this probably would fall below and organization’s risk threshold and would not need to be reported. OMB M-17-12 does not provide bright line rules to define what is considered “sensitive PII” using the common dictionary definition approach to the language in the memorandum–and under what circumstances a privacy breach should be reported, both because it would be a futile effort to attempt to delineate or predict the myriad potential contexts and situations, and agencies are in the best position to know and understand the relevant circumstances of their PII to determine which PII is sensitive and which breaches create risk.\r\n\r\n',' AR-1, AR-4, AR-5, AR-6, AU-1, AU-2, AU-3, AU-4, AU-5, AU-6, AU-7, AU-8, AU-9, AU-10, AU-11, AU-12, AU-13, AU-14, IR-1, IR-2, IR-3, IR-4, IR-5, IR-6, IR-7, IR-8, RA-1'),(480,'SE-COSA-01','Security','Non-Mandatory: Security Control Family Policy and Procedures ','P3','','The organization: a.

Effective notice also demonstrates the privacy considerations that the organization has addressed in implementing its information practices. The organization may provide public notice through a variety of means. Some of these may be required by law or regulations, such as system of records notices (SORN) for Privacy Act systems, privacy impact assessments (PIA) for agency information systems and electronic collections of information, and website privacy policies for agency websites. As required by the Privacy Act, the organization also provides direct notice to individuals via Privacy Act Statements on the paper and electronic forms it uses to collect PII, or on separate forms that can be retained by the individuals.The Senior Official for Privacy (SOP) is responsible for the content of the organization’s public notices, in consultation with legal counsel and relevant program managers. The public notice requirement in this control may be satisfied by an organization’s compliance with the public notice requirements of federal laws, regulations, and guidelines, such as: Provisions of the Privacy Act,The E-Government Act’s PIA requirement,OMB Memoranda including M 03-22 (Guidance for Implementing the Privacy Provisions of the E-Government Act of 2002), 17-06 (Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services), 10-22 (Guidance for Online Use of Web Measurement and Customization Technology), and 10-23 (Guidance for Agency Use of Third-Party Websites and Applications),The Children’s Online Privacy Protection Act (COPPA), andThe HIPAA Privacy Rule, Section 45 CFR § 164.520, “Notice of privacy practices for protected health information.” Changing PII practice or policy without prior notice is disfavored and should only be undertaken in consultation with the SOP and Chief Counsel.The website privacy policy described by OMB M-17-12, Policies for Federal Agency Public Websites and Digital Services, frequently referred to on organization websites as a “Privacy Policy” or “Privacy and Security Notice,” is intended as a broad notice of website privacy policies and general website use, and will not by itself meet the requirement for specific notice when collecting PII. When PII is maintained (including collection) in a system of records that is covered by the Privacy Act, the organization must provide a “Privacy Act Statement” to the individual at the time of collection that meets the requirements of the Privacy Act of 1974, 5 U.S.C. §552a(e)(3), unless the organization has published a rule exempting that system of records from the (e)(3) notice provision in accordance with subsection (j) of the Privacy Act. If the PII is not maintained in a system of records under the Privacy Act, a privacy notice should be provided which describes the privacy practices associated with that PII, including, but not limited to, the way the PII is protected, how it is used, and whether it is shared. To avoid confusion, this type of privacy notice must not be labeled as a “Privacy Act Statement.” As an alternative, several organizations refer to this notice type as a “Privacy Advisory.”\r\n\r\nGuidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PHI:\r\n\r\nThe HIPAA Privacy Rule also requires a privacy notice referred to as a “Notice of Privacy Practices.” For specific rules on this notice please refer to 45 C.F.R. §164.520.\r\n\r\n',' AP-1, AP-2, AR-1, AR-2, IP-1, IP-2, IP-3, UL-1, UL-2'),(482,'TR-01(01)','Transparency','Real-Time or Layered Notice ','P1','High; Moderate; Low','Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nThe organization provides real-time and/or layered notice when it collects PII.\r\n\r\n','Guidance for systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):\r\n\r\nReal-time notice facilitates informed consent and promotes trust from the individual when collecting sensitive PII.

The Privacy Act notes that it uses “maintain” to include “maintain, collect, use or disseminate.” These requirements impact decisions made during planning, design, development, and operation of programs and systems.Organizations issue SORNs to provide the public notice regarding PII collected in a system of records, which the Privacy Act defines as “a group of any records under the control of any agency from which information is retrieved by the name of an individual or by some identifying number, symbol, or another identifier.” SORNs explain how the information is used, retained, and may be corrected, and whether certain portions of the system are subject to Privacy Act exemptions for law enforcement or national security reasons. Privacy Act Statements provide notice of: (i) the authority of organizations to collect PII; (ii) whether providing PII is mandatory or optional; (iii) the principal purpose(s) for which the PII is to be used; (iv) the intended disclosures (routine uses) of the information; and (v) the consequences of not providing all or some portion of the information requested. When information is collected verbally, organizations read a Privacy Act Statement prior to initiating the collection of PII (for example, when conducting telephone interviews or surveys).The Privacy Act and OMB guidance set forth specific requirements regarding when and how notices are provided. In addition to any internal organization review process, the publication of a SORN in the Federal Register requires a mandatory review and comment period of a minimum of 40 days. Regarding TR-2, paragraph a, the publication of a SORN is required only when the PII is maintained in a system that meets the statutory definition of a “system of records” under the Privacy Act.
