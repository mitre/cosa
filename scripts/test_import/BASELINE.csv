Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):
Determine if the organization describes the purpose(s) for which PII is collected, used, maintained, and shared in its privacy notices.
Determine if:
(i) The system collects and uses PII only if the PII is relevant to its purposes;
(ii) PII entering the system from other systems is limited to predetermined data elements.
(iii) Generation of new PII is restricted to pre-determined data elements;
(iv) PII output is properly labeled regarding permissible uses and restrictions on usage of the PII;
(v) PII is transferred to other entities (e.g., other agencies or third parties) only if those entities are authorized to receive it and only for predetermined, documented purposes
and business needs;
(vi) When transferring PII to other entities via the user interface, the system notifies the user of the permissible uses and restrictions on usage of the PII;(vi) When
transferring PII to other agency systems or to third parties via the user interface, the system notifies the user of the permissible uses and restrictions on usage of the PII;
(vii) User interfaces provide a notification when saving PII outside the system or printing PII, reminding the user of the permissible uses and restrictions on usage of the PII;
and
(viii) The system limits disclosure of PII to those data elements that are necessary for the purposes of the system.
Assessment Methods and Objects:
Systems processing, storing, or transmitting PII (to include PHI):
Examine: Privacy notice that describes the purpose for which PII can be collected, used, maintained, and shared; other relevant documents or records.
Examine: System data model and database architecture and associate each PII data element or logical aggregate of elements (e.g., mailing address) with a rationale for its
inclusion. Comment: Purpose Limitation is fundamentally system-specific. The implementation of this principle is heavily dependent on legal authorization and policy and
could vary greatly for individual systems. Of the Enterprise Privacy Requirements, this is likely the most difficult for generating  tests.
Examine: User interfaces in which PII is entered. Establish rationale for any unstructured capture mechanisms (e.g., free text boxes). Comment: Structured mechanisms for
capturing PII input (e.g., discrete and appropriately formatted input fields for specific PII data elements) help constrain the PII that can be captured
Examine: Display screens for evidence of appropriate warning. Comment: Unstructured data inputs pose a risk, as they are difficult to govern and users can enter any
information they choose.
Examine: Interfaces to verify PII data elements being requested. Comment: Individual queries may also be executed. Volume of queries may drive the approach used.
Examine: Interfaces to verify PII data elements being received. Comment: May also send full record to system, including unnecessary PII data elements. Unnecessary PII
data elements may also be sent individually; however, it is likely more efficient/feasible to send a record that contains multiple types of elements that should not be
accepted.
Examine: Output of each system function for PII data elements.
Test: Attempt to save a file or data extract from the system that contains PII.
Test: Attempt to print a file containing PII from the system. Comment: Notification may be handled in multiple ways, depending on the capabilities of the system, including
screen views or pop-up notices.
Test: Create and save a file containing system output with PII and review the label associated with it. Comment: This requirement depends on system capabilities. When
available, automated means of applying labels should be used.
Test: Print a file containing PII and review the label printed on it. Comment: Labels may include a file header or footer, a watermark, a designation in the file name, or some
other means of communicating the authorized purpose.
Test: Create and save a file containing system output with PII. Attempt to alter the label that communicates the authorized use. Attempt to remove the label that
communicates the authorized use. Comment: When practical for the purpose, consider making electronic file outputs read-only.
Test: Submit a request to print a report containing PII. Attempt to alter the label that communicates the authorized use. Attempt to remove the label that communicates the
authorized use.

Test: Attempt to connect from an unauthorized system and transfer PII out of the system.
Test: Attempt to initiate from system transfer of PII to an unauthorized system. Comment: Sharing agreements with other entities may include information documented in
SORNs, information sharing agreements (ISA), memoranda of understanding (MOU), memoranda of agreement (MOA), and other formal agreements.
Test: Attempt to transfer PII from the system and observe any notification provided. Comment: Notification may be handled in multiple ways, depending on the capabilities
of the system, including screen views or pop-up notices. Depending on business requirements, the system may also be required to support an acknowledgement of notice
received by the user.
Examine: Target system updates to verify PII data elements being sent.
Test: Attempt queries from target systems for PII data elements not pre-determined to be necessary. Comment: Additional thought may be required when full records are
being disclosed, including whether disclosure of the full record (instead of specific data elements) is compatible with the purposes of the system.

Examine: The system architecture and identify the PII stored by the system.
Examine: Test records processed by the system.
Examine: Interfaces to the data stores to verify that PII is being saved in the intended data stores.
Test: Attempt to use the system to save PII to an unauthorized data store. Comment: Consider the impact of cloud computing, shared disk arrays, and other technologies in
identifying the risk of saving information to an incorrect location.
Examine: The data model and data store architecture for retention tracking. Comment: Data tags, date stamps, metadata, and other mechanisms may be used to support
this requirement.
Examine: Test data in the system for association with relevant retention periods.
Test: Instantiate test data with a designated retention period and observe what happens when the retention period expires. Comment: Unless there is a business need to
retain PII for historical purposes, it should be deleted when no longer needed.
Examine: The backup scripts and procedures to ensure PII is backed up in a manner that is consistent with the retention periods defined in the Records Control Schedules.
Comment: Records Control Schedules may vary from system to system. The test assumes that the cognizant authority has approved the Records Control Schedules and
that these are consistent with the retention periods documented in the SORN(s) that cover this system. The schedule for rotation and overwriting backup media should be
considered to further ensure retention periods are not exceeded.
Examine: Deletion routine for search and delete functionality.
Test: Load test input data to produce multiple instances of processed PII. Initiate processing and deletion, then manually query the database for the presence of each
instance of PII.
Examine: The designated locations for temp files created by the system�s normal processes. Review the contents of any persistent temp files following a transaction or
process involving PII.
